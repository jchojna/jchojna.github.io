# My Frontend Portfolio

## Project info
This project you have already started exploring and it’s what you are viewing right now. It presents five most representative frontend projects of mine (including itself) placed in separate sections, starting from the ones I am proud of the most. In addition, the other section contains a few more straightforward and exercise projects I created in the beginning of my frontend journey.

I tried to emphasize creative and dynamic character of this SPA website mostly by providing noticeable level of interaction with a visual output and quite many animated elements. At the same time, I tried not to cross the line of exaggeration regarding transforming elements and kept my eye on performance aspect so the transitions would appear relatively smooth.

In order to distinguish one section from another I assumed a design rule, that each section has its own independent color palette. Because of many color shades in every section, there is 68 colors in total on this page and it’s one of those moments when SCSS comes in handy… In this project I decided not to use any javascript frameworks, just vanilla JS.
