# Portfolio Project

This repository contains my portfolio project, showcasing various pet projects I've worked on and some information about me and my professional experience and education. The site is a Single Page Application (SPA) with a focus on interactivity and animation, balanced with performance considerations to ensure smooth transitions. The project was initially built with vanilla JS and later rewritten to Typescript and React."

## Features

- code splitting using Suspense and lazy functions
- async/await code for executing intro animations in a sequence
- using github API to fetch project details data
- custom accordions without use of third-party libraries
- extensive use of SVG elements - logos, graphics, menu items
- different menu components for mobile and desktop devices
