    "This section contains all the training projects, which are either just starting to take shape or had stopped being developed at some point. I decided to share them anyway to show my very first steps in frontend development or present some quick exercise projects, but keep in mind that most of them hasn't been updated for a long time and the code doesn't always reflect my current level of advancement."
