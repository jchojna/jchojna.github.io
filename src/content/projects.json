      "You could say it's just another Pomodoro Clock react app, but this one is a little bit more complex and playful. I tried to make it look more like a board game with cards, interactive and entertaining. The app can handle multiple tasks going on at the same time, even though it may not be too practical to work on many tasks simultaneously, but it's nice to see them all in action anyway:)",
      "For GIT training purposes, the app has started being developed in multiple phases: as a static page (static-page branch), as vanilla JS app using document.createElement (vanilla branch), as vanilla JS to react.js rewriting phase with use of React.createElement, but no JSX yet (react-no-jsx branch), previous and simpler version of the app created using create-react-app seed is located on react-simple branch app's version on master branch is still being developed as the main app"

      "Simple yet useful app for daily tracking of water consumption. User can quickly get to basic app’s functionality and add (or remove) next glass of drank water what may help with not forgetting about this really important activity, especially during hot summer.. There’s also an archive section with an editable history entries divided on weeks, to have an overall insight into water consumption tendency. On top of that, user is able to change his account settings and view his or other users stats. I added some level of gamification in form of points collected by every user for 'minimum water' streaks. There is also an overall ranking of users, dynamically reacting to any change in users stats."

In addition, the other section contains a few more straightforward and exercise projects I created in the beginning of my frontend journey.",
      "I tried to emphasize creative and dynamic character of this SPA website mostly by providing noticeable level of interaction with a visual output and quite many animated elements. At the same time, I tried not to cross the line of exaggeration regarding transforming elements and kept my eye on performance aspect so the transitions would appear relatively smooth.",
      "In order to distinguish one section from another I assumed a design rule, that each section has its own independent color palette. Because of many color shades in every section, there is 68 colors in total on this page and it’s one of those moments when SCSS comes in handy… In this project I decided not to use any javascript frameworks, just vanilla JS."

      "I decided not to use any external libraries and write all the functions by myself (exception: throttle function from Underscore.js). All the visualizations used on this website were created by me, while I have been working as an architectural visualizer."
