    "description": "As an architect I have a background in programming parametric architecture using tools like Grasshopper and Kangaroo. Long experience in 3d graphic and architectural visualization industry ad a strong impact on my sense of aesthetics and visual composition. I also had an encounter with motion design and compositing. During my one year stay in Slovenia, I had an opportunity to work in English-speaking environment. As an individual, I think I would describe myself as a self-taught, multipotentialite person with a certain dose of perfectionism. After I had created my first personal portfolio website in Wordpress, I decided to take my chances in frontend development about one year ago and learn it after hours. I have taken some online courses, but first of all I focused on writing my own projects and learning by practice. I tried to avoid using external libraries where I possibly could while writing the code, to get better understanding of HTML, CSS and JS basics. What I like about frontend web development is an endless process of learning, logical and analytical thinking and that it enables me to connect my previous experience backgrounds at some level."
